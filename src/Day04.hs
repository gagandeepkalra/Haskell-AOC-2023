--you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers.
--The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles
--the point value of that card.
--
--For example:
--
--Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
--Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
--Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1

--Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches.
--So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
